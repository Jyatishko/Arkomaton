### What is Arkomaton?
Arkomaton is a simple lightweight file which you can use to download your favorite Spotify playlists for free. However, it is only for **Windows.** I'll try to code it for mac and linux on the future updates.
### How do I use it?
It's very simple to use it. Here is a step-by-step guide to using it:

- Download the latest version of Arkomaton.
- After installing, **DO NOT RUN THE FILE.** It will 100% crash. What you need to do is, open cmd first. 
- After opening, paste this command 
`pip install yt-dlp mutagen ytmusicapi spotipy requests`
- What this will do is, it will download all the necessary packages needed for the working of this file.
- After the packages are installed, head to [Spotify Bot Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and make a bot.

- Copy the client ID and then paste where it says `your spotify client ID`
- Do the same with Client secret.
- For genius, go to [API Client | Genius](https://genius.com/api-clients)
- Do the same as done in Spotify Bot Dashboard. But instead of client ID or secret, click on "Generate access token".

- Now you are good to go! Enjoy your playlists and albums!
